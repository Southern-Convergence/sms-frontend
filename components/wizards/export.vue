<!--
  The export wizard is another component that I originally made for Prime Strat but gradually became a general use component.

  It is a component that allows us to share a common facility for exporting application data.

  It's operation is simple:

  * You feed it an array of your application data to export.
  * It reads this array and outputs it into a preview table.
  * Poof, done, a user may use the available options for export such as selecting rows, fields, and even the resulting output file.
